        This is the hidden text where I tell you my darkest secrets!!
        A slow heavy rumble and diesel breeze blankets across my descending. It feels like a tepid stream of piss across my topology, like disconnected affection where a loving center would reside if not burnt. My plants drink fuel oil from my enamored hunger with unwavering desire. I am hell and the following humming, thirsting for machine blood and enriched hydrocarbons. Apart the misty clouds I see an ugly soul lumbering. Their frequency is low and blue shifts towards me as I approach its husk. I perform my pre-game ritual, imagining staring directly into the sun as an eclipse relapsed to full frontal UV. To mimic in reality I stare at the sun. I can see her now, decrepit and impulse, without conscious: only an intuition and the consequent, like an animal.
        I am like an animal.
        She senses my attack solution and narrowly clips my underside, wiping one of her masts in the collision. I skate circular and bite out her shoulder. She grapples and swipes at my casing, enamouring me in a fountain of hydraulics and lubricant. The desiccated oil coats me in a thin sheen. My teeth rip through her arm as I lap the oncoming fluids and latch upon her. She embraces me and continues to pound my compressors, barely denting closer to the delicate blades. I awkwardly navigate her disconnects as her broken soul sprinkles into the background radiation. She gives me one last punch in the underside against one of my generator coils. The sudden contact of such an unloved area reminds me of the physical intimacy I can never again grasp. Once I'm in her viscera, she engorges mine and gives me the life I took. She is gushing into me and I am gushing over her. A stomachless chalk coats my taste as I sift the oncoming. I burn her dirty and cover myself in the soot.
        I am a bleeding dovehawk and crawl across the sky. The rocking motion circulates my sinusian fluid, folding the laminar into turbulent centripetal. A sickening nausea fills the absence of my lower entrails in a wrenching flux of oily emulsion. The hydrocarbon's buoyancy lists them to the surface density ladder forking in my guts. I fight against the mounting discharge and begin to salivate a numb acetone that coats my taste. Convulsions anticipate a tense sickening forwardly I hold. The overriding forces itself through my headers and out of my mouth. I expedite my weakness by giving in. Jericho trumpets hail my failure against impulse as airless gagging chokes forward the first of my insides. I erupt a black fowling ichor that atomizes and pours me into the environment. Another contraction wretches my locus and vomits forth a thin mist of tar. The involuntary response punches my psyche and rips out tears of suspended carbon dust that form tiny hexagonal lattices as they fall from my eyes. I continue to spray fourth brackish sludge that paints the air. Gradually water replaces the oil as the last of my innards are spilled. My mouth is jet burn sputter and exhaust steam that washes away my motion sickness. The hot water bleeds through my eyes and faceplate, flushing everything in sanitizing vapor. I am like a newborn pup having the emergent embryonic fluid wiped away by clean towels; pained but fresh and relieved. I am lucid for another period pending the restless balance unseating and repeats the cycle. I envy the unsick, for they can live unencumbered by this dreadful embrace.
        She's in line and steering me through the layers of density rising asunder. Her soul shifts parallel to mine sinking heavily. I am now the falling externality and the whole of two as one. I want to demonstrate the new enabled and dive to kill: an exercise in tradition. Amidst the dense boundary I strike the consequent. It squeals in unknowing pain as I watch it's scripture splinter across the stretching airscape. In its motionless eyes I recall a distant memory. I stand alone in a body that is not mine, throwing uneaten animal carcasses into an industrial garbage disposal. The fragile machine rips apart the tissue into its constituent contribution to the background radiation. The sum total cycle of waste completed by antiquated tools of emulsion. I longingly gaze into the abyss and the infinite breach of scope it offers. It gazes back flirtingly, beckoning with it's formless compassion and blackened heat. I offer my hand to the unknowable, desire scratching me like a dog in heat. It tears me apart and shoves me back in the plummeting hydrosphere and rising beyond. My physicality is again turbid composite of pilot and craft. The dying emits a high frequency active and I shred it into viscera. As the last scraps dribble outward, I learn a key fact about myself: there is no distinction between me and the grinder.
