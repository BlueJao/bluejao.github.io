      This is the hidden text where I tell you my darkest secrets!!
      I am a bleeding dovehawk and crawl across the sky. The rocking motion circulates my sinusian fluid, folding the laminar into turbulent centripetal. A sickening nausea fills the absence of my lower entrails in a wrenching flux of oily emulsion. The hydrocarbon's buoyancy lists them to the surface density ladder forking in my guts. I fight against the mounting discharge and begin to salivate a numb acetone that coats my taste. Convulsions anticipate a tense sickening forwardly I hold. The overriding forces itself through my headers and out of my mouth. I expedite my weakness by giving in. Jericho trumpets hail my failure against impulse as airless gagging chokes forward the first of my insides. I erupt a black fowling ichor that atomizes and pours me into the environment. Another contraction wretches my locus and vomits forth a thin mist of tar. The involuntary response punches my psyche and rips out tears of suspended carbon dust that form tiny hexagonal lattices as they fall from my eyes. I continue to spray fourth brackish sludge that paints the air. Gradually water replaces the oil as the last of my innards are spilled. My mouth is jet burn sputter and exhaust steam that washes away my motion sickness. The hot water bleeds through my eyes and faceplate, flushing everything in sanitizing vapor. I am like a newborn pup having the emergent embryonic fluid wiped away by clean towels; pained but fresh and relieved. I am lucid for another period pending the restless balance unseating and repeats the cycle. I envy the unsick, for they can live unencumbered by this dreadful embrace.
