The wall is going up. We're not the good guys, but neither are the other participants of the great power struggle. I have a responsibility to my country to help them outmode all others. It's going to bring about the end of the world. I'm part of the problem, but we all are. We're too deep into it. It doesn't stop me from enjoying the problem. My engineering brain is one tracked to solve engineering problems. Here I solve and facilitate. Here I am operational. The collective consequences of me and everyone like me will come in due time, and hopefully the next generation of brilliant minds can deal with the fallout, as is the prayer that has echoed the halls of man since the first spear was carved.
