          I haven't left my house in weeks, and you know what? That's ultimately alright. Ever since the loss and subversion of everything I hold dear I haven't been able to stand the light. I hear things have improved, but that world's not for me. Here in my room I can just suck up, shut out, and live. Here is the envy of all the living. Life washes me like a warm bath, and passes me by. It's okay.
