The chance slipped right through my hands. I got caught on the fence. Maybe I was too greedy, maybe too ambitious. Sartre once said "A man cannot condemn. himself". Just to spite him: fuck me. I always had more left in the tank after the finish line. The complacent allure of "better than most" clipped me on the up, and I biffed the landing. Shit rolls down hill and falls apart. What am I going to do, not give it away?
