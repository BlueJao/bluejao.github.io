My husband and I are more like roommates than anything else. Familiarity breeds contempt, and I guess in that I can acquiesce. It's been a long ride to get this far, and at this point I value the familiarity more than the risk of tearing it down to start again, especially with how the world is. I feel bad for my two wonderful children. I'm so proud of them. I left them a world that's going to be very difficult to navigate, but hopefully I gave them enough skills that they'll do well without me. Now that they're off to college, I finally have enough time to start getting back into my hobbies, at least the ones that I haven't been priced out of. There's been a year overcast, but I'm not sure I would have done it any differently. I don't even know if there would be a different way.
