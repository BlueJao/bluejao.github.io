Brutal light beams across the monastic walls of my cave. Unencumbered by worldly possessions and desires, I can live in total memorial of those that I have lost. Just as they have passed, I will too. Through force of will I slowly desiccate and self mummify; the ultimate expression of my humanity. It's cold and yet I persist. The air thins as it steals the moisture from each breath. My diaphragm continues with slow, deep, deliberate contraction.
