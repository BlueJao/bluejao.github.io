By walking a million edge cases, I've found my stride. In the balance of found and inherited, a fragile yet robust soul takes root and blossoms forth. My friends and family, the conditions for my achievement, my contribution towards a better, more sustainable presence. The continuity of all life triumphs bravely over anti-human systems, and we make it work in cooperation vice competition. Warmth can be taught; nurtured into existence despite the historical evidence to the contrary. THis is the defining trait of “us”. This is the sun by which all things come into being, and become eventually recycled: appreciated in full sincerity. Together we flourish. Defiant of standard, but inclusive of the same. A million deliberate technicalities. In recognition of the cliche sentiment, but living it none the less. Love wins. It sprawls in its rhyzomous garden.
