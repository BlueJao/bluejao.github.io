  Black coffee and restless nights have me poised like a vigilante. The tenderness down to me in life will be reciprocated through my performative watch. I know so maybe things I can use to help people, and yet my ability to communicate those things is impotent. All I can do is selfishly chase altruism. The awkward reflection snubs out years built charisma.  No one asked for me, and yet I am.
