          Have you seen the new show on Pluto max? It's peak, fucking peak. My favorite vtuber made a video essay about it, and oh my god it's like giving my thoughts exactly. Wanna doordash some Wendy's and binge it tonight. I literally got us poppers so we could stay up all night. Like, I know there's another forest fire, but there's gonna be no one on the roads. Do you wanna fuck on the highway? No pressure, but we could fuck on the highway. We also so gotta schedule that double feature trip to Disneyland and burning man.
