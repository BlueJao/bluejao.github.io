There's so many things to be afraid of, and I can't shake the feeling that the walls are closing in. I try to give my money away. but it's never enough. There's too many mutual aid campaigns, and it feels pointless to spread myself thinly across all of them. But what else would I do? If I preferentially award money to people that's reinforcing the same systems that kill everything. It's all so fucked. I wake up every morning, but why bother? What I can give isn't appreciated or effective. I might as well have been a ghost, circumnavigating the Earth.        </p>
