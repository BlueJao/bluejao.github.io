They really let anyone do anything. Post-modernism has won, and baby, you best believe I am taking advantage of no objective morality. Intuition be damned, I can gear the existing infrastructure to support my means, my achievement, my greatest art. I’ve been everyone, I’ve done everything, I’m everyone, man. The world is a trash pile, pliable like slicked clay and I’m the only one with enough ambition and balls to actually mold it. My employees are my largest asset. They get only the best. Every door shut for someone else offers them assimilation into my domain. We’re doing great things. The technical competence and streamlined efficiency of every aspect of life really lets one appreciate the true power of collective work. The dyson sphere’s framework is complete. We’re going to be pure fucking light.
