Shame is a concept for the uninitiated who still abide by their internalized fear of repremendment. One by one I'm going to show each and every victim of residual Christian guilt that they deserve love, or at the very least deserve having someone making them feel good. Tender hearts match with tender body parts, I will never turn anyone down who wants the experience. I find great fulfillment from seeing the spark of reckless abandon ignite in someone's eyes the first time they cum from another. A few people catch feelings, but I have to turn them down. It's sad, but there's too many people to help, and so I cannot settle; too many eyes to open and eggs to crack.
