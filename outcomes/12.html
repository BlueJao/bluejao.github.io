The reductionist effete can never interface with the working class. I am not blue collar, but they are my friends, my constituents, my fountainhead. Through hard work and slow tangible progress we can rise together. The world is predicated on infrastructure built by us, maintained by us, defended by us. It's always been this way, since the first abstract thoughts severed our seamlessness with the material. Now it is merely extensions of ourselves vice fully integrated. As a leader, I am in turn led. My example sets the foundations from which the next arcologies and pantheons shall be built. When asked to surrender my role in this construction, I simply reply "more weight".
