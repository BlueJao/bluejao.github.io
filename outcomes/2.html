The fruit of labor takes a long time to materialize. The things under my care are all extensions of myself, and as such require my life's devotion. Today I am the gardener, tomorrow I am the dirt. Through the grace of others I can facilitate my selfish devotion. The others like me share their knowledge in a collective library, but I have never made a discovery that warrants my own contribution. I feel no remorse for that which I take, knowing that one day, I too will be taken.        </p>
