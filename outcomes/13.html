Seeing a child drinking from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup and remarked, "A child has beaten me in the plainness of living." For as long as there is organization, there will be affluence. The conceptualization of the non-living as related to a human being is an evil equation of value. When a sign exists, the understanding of that sign can supersede the value of the person facilitating the understanding. This is the nature of civilization. The fundamental goal of hierarchy is to create the conditions by which something of value can be extracted from someone in service of an abstraction. The teeth of the human meat grinder is wetted with the blood of this currency. While I exist only because of the affluences awarded to me through conflict, I am destined to deface the currency.
