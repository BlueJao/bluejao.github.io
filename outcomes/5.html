Fuck you, I got mine! The burden of family and friends has long since been rightfully shed in service of my accomplishments. My bitch mother and impotent dad can't hold a candle to the sheer material success I have. I've built my wealth on the backs of dumb fucks who couldn't help themselves. If I didn't do it, someone else would've; I am just playing my part. The tasteless dredges of my country club covet my position. They don't know I'm going to run for office soon. They want me dead. When I win I'm going to fucking route them.
