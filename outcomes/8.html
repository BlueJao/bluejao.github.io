I physically peaked in my early 20s. At 28 all of the wear in my body coalesced. It wouldn't be fair otherwise. My constitution, my will, is too strong to be unencumbered. It actually fucking kills me to stay here like this. I've read every book on my list, seen every movie, listened to every album.  My tastes extend to the depths of every sacred underground and friendly vault. With low mobility, I can only really live vicariously through these curated works. I'm going to fucking shoot the next solicitor unfortunate enough to feign illiteracy to get to my door.
